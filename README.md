 Snabbit Price Calculation API This project implements a price calculation system using FastAPI that determines the cost of sports facility bookings based on different pricing rules. The API provides endpoints to calculate the price of bookings, considering factors like duration, time of day, specific date overrides, and the day of the week. The system is designed to be flexible and extendable, allowing pricing adjustments based on various factors such as special discounts, peak times, or seasonal pricing.  Key Features Dynamic Pricing: Pricing for sports is based on duration (60, 90, 120 minutes) and can be modified using pricing overrides. Date and Time Based Pricing: Pricing can be adjusted for specific dates and times. For example, prices can increase or decrease for weekends, holidays, or particular time slots. CORS Support: The application supports CORS to allow access from any origin, enabling easy integration with frontend applications. Database Integration: Uses SQLAlchemy for ORM (Object Relational Mapping) to manage sports pricing and override data in a database. FastAPI Framework: The project leverages FastAPI for fast, modern, and scalable API development. Technologies Used FastAPI: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. SQLAlchemy: ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library for database interactions. SQLite: A simple and lightweight database engine used for storing pricing data and overrides. Pydantic: For data validation and serialization in FastAPI. Uvicorn: ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
